# 1KGP High-Coverage VCF Processing Pipeline (hg38, HPC Version)

This HPC-optimized pipeline automates the extraction, filtering, and transformation of 1000 Genomes Project high-coverage (hg38) VCFs into population-specific, dbSNP-verified, and PLINK-compatible files. It leverages `bcftools`, `plink`, and GNU `parallel` for efficient chromosome- and population-level processing on high-performance clusters.

## üß∞ Dependencies

Ensure the following tools are available in your environment:

- [`bcftools`](bcftools/1.19-openblas-2333)
- [`plink2`](plink2/2.00a4.3-netlib-lapack-qbk6)

## üóÇ Inputs

- **Chromosome VCFs:**  
  Used /script/download.sh to download from the 1000 Genomes high-coverage data (hg38), one file per chr1‚Äì22 and X, stored in `vcfFiles/`. 
- **Sample Lists:**  
  One per population (e.g., `sampleName_EUR.txt`, `sampleName_AFR.txt`), stored in `sampleName/`.  
  ‚û§ *Each list contains sample IDs corresponding to individuals from that population.*

- **dbSNP v157 hg38 (biallelic rsIDs only):**  
  TAB-delimited file: `dbsnp157_biallelic_rs_hg38_UCSC.tab`  
  Path: `repo/data/genomeRef/dbsnp157_biallelic_rs_hg38_UCSC.tab/`  
  ‚û§ *Used to retain known and reliable SNPs.*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Overview

### Step 1: **Chromosome + Population Filtering**
- Extracts VCF sample names
- Filters to keep only samples for the selected population
- Filters for SNPs only, and retains those with **MAF > 0.01**
- Outputs filtered `.vcf.gz` and associated variant list

### Step 2: **dbSNP Verification**
- Intersects filtered variants with `dbsnp157_biallelic_rs_hg38` to ensure known SNPs
- Generates:
  - Filtered `.vcf.gz`
  - `.tab` files listing positions before and after dbSNP filtering

### Step 3: **Parallel Execution**
- Steps 1‚Äì2 are run in parallel across all chromosomes and populations using `GNU parallel`

### Step 4: **VCF Merging**
- Merges filtered per-chromosome VCFs into population-wide VCFs
- Output: `mergedPopVcf/<pop>_merged.vcf.gz`

### Step 5: **Convert to PLINK Format**
- Uses `plink` to convert merged VCFs to `.bed/.bim/.fam` for downstream GWAS or analysis

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Make script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x process_1kg_pipeline.sh
   ```

2. **Run the pipeline:**
   ```bash
   ./process_1kg_pipeline.sh
   ```

3. **Control parallelism:**  
   The number of concurrent jobs (`-j`) can be tuned at the bottom of the script to match your HPC cluster limits.

## üì§ Output Files

- `vcfPops/chr<chr>_<pop>_only.vcf.gz` ‚Äì SNPs filtered by population
- `vcfPops/chr<chr>_<pop>_only_varList.tab` ‚Äì Variant positions (pre-dbsnp filtering)
- `vcfPops/chr<chr>_<pop>_only_varList_filtered.tab` ‚Äì Variants retained after dbSNP filter

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- **Sample ID Matching:** Make sure your `sampleName_*.txt` contains correct sample IDs matching those in the 1KGP VCFs.
- **Missing Samples:** Some population lists may include samples not present in VCFs; those are logged in `notInVcfSample/`.
- **Logging:** Full per-task logs can be found in `vcfPops/logs/`.
